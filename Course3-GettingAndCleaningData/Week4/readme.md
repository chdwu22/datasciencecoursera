This is a set of tidy data collected using smartphones for human activity recognition. 
"tidy_data1.csv" shows the data collected from the six different movement of 30 participants.
The six moves are: walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.
"tidy_data_average.csv" shows the average of each variable by participant and movement.
As documented in

the collected data types include the following:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

where '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation
